    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Solyanka is a thick, spicy and sour Russian soup that is common in Russia and other 
        states of the former Soviet Union and certain parts of the former Eastern Bloc.
    </p>
    <p>Solyanka is popular in the former East Germany where it is commonly found in 
        restaurants and available in canned form in grocery stores. This practice stems from 
        the era when Soviet troops were stationed in the GDR, and Soljanka was found on the 
        menu at many East German restaurants.
